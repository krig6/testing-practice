# Webpack Template

Welcome to the Webpack Template! ðŸŽ‰ This template provides a solid foundation for starting a modern JavaScript project with Webpack, including development and production setups.

## Features

- Development and Production Builds: Separate configurations for development (webpack.dev.js) and production (webpack.prod.js).
- CSS and Asset Handling: Pre-configured loaders for CSS and image files.
- HTML Generation: Automatically generates an HTML file with dynamic script inclusion using HtmlWebpackPlugin.
- Hot Module Replacement: Enables fast, live updates during development.
- Optimized Output: Uses content hashing for cache busting in production builds.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to create a new project using this template:

### 1. Use this Template

Click the "**Use this template**" button on the repository page to create a new repository based on this template.

Alternatively, you can create a new repository and set this template as the upstream:

```bash
git clone <template-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:<gitub-username>/<new-repository-name>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Launch the development server with hot reloading enabled:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server at http://localhost:3000 by default.

### 4. Build for Production

Generate an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the dist directory.

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

To deploy your project to GitHub Pages, use:

```
npm run deploy
```

This script will deploy the contents of the dist directory to the gh-pages branch of your repository, making it available at https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;.

Note: Replace &lt;username&gt; with your GitHub username and &lt;repository-name&gt; with the name of your repository.
